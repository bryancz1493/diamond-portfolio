            <p>I am Bryan, and I have a twin brother, and he looks exactly like me! I am working as a civil engineer now. The reason I decided to join this bootcamp is I wanted to do coding for my degree, but it is too late for me to change my path in my senior year. So, I decided to attend UCB bootcamp to learn more about coding. My goal for this class is to be a back-end developer. Although things we are learning now are front-end related, I think things will work out well if I grind hard enough. "It is how much you desire about it. How much you want it."
